English Improvement Bot, an open source chatbot designed to help you improve your English skills. With this bot, you can build your own personal dictionary of words, and test your knowledge with random quizzes that feature images and descriptions. The bot is developed using [GO+Python] and runs on our own server.

Plan to add support for mobile app integration in the future. I developed this bot just for myself, but we are happy to share it with the community as an open source project. Feel free to use, modify, and distribute the bot as you see fit, subject to the terms of the MIT license.
